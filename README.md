ZX Spectrum related experimentations and investigations

uspeech
* after seeing a Facebook posting I was inspired to create a disassembly of the Currah Microspeech ROM, by hand.

z80tomem
* takes a "z80" format snapshot and a ZX ROM image file and makes a 64k image of memory.

z80dismap
* experiment to take a 64k image of memory (see z80tomem) and a start program counter and do a very simple "trace" to identify code and data regions.

* very long time ago I transferred some stuff over serial from a ZX Spectrum to an Amiga somehow ending up with two files for each ZX file, a "header" and a "bytes" file. This is a simple hack to make a TZX usable in an emulator.
